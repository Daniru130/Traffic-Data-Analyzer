TrafficFlow Analyzer

A Python-based traffic flow simulation and analytics tool designed to model vehicle movements, calculate congestion patterns, and evaluate traffic efficiency under various scenarios. This project is ideal for learning simulation logic, working with algorithms, and understanding real-world traffic behaviors.

Features

Simulates vehicle movement across a defined road network

Calculates congestion levels and road usage

Provides summary reports of overall traffic flow

Supports adjustable simulation parameters

Modular Python code structure for easy modification
